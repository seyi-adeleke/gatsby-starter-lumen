Hello,
I'm Seyi, a self taught fullstack engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria. I use tools like **Javascript**, **PHP** and **GoLang** to build 
software and web applications. I currently work at [Andela](https://www.andela.com). 

I'm currently obsessed with command line utilities and I spend most of my free time building tools that encourage my laziness.

I'm always happy to bounce around ideas, talk about a Project or anything in particular. You can reach me on my Social Media or preferably send me an [email](mailto:adelekeadetokunbo01@gmail.com)
